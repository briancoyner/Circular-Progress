    /// Implementations must not adjust the layer's bounds or position. Doing so will most
    /// certainly cause layout issues.
    ///
    /// Implementations are free to modify the layer's "style" (e.g. `lineWidth`) based on the
    /// given `radius` value.
    ///
    /// Implementations may add custom sublayers to the `additionalContentLayer`. For example,
    /// an implementation may add a text layer displaying the current progress as a string.
    ///
    /// - Parameters:
    ///   - layers: a collection of layers that can be adjusted per the requirements of the strategy.
    ///   - center: the progress view's center/ position relative to the view.
    ///   - radius: the current radius.

    ///   - state: the view's new state.
    ///   - tintColor: the current tint color (provided as a convenience in case it's needed).

    ///   - center: the progress view's center/ position relative to the view.
    ///   - radius: the current radius.
    ///   - angle: the current angle (radians).
    /// - Returns: a new `CGPath` representing the current progress.
